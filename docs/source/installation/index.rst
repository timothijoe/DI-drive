Prerequisites
=================

System version:

    * Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04
    * Windows 10

Python version: 3.6, 3.7

PyTorch version: >=1.4, <=1.8

DI-engine version: >=0.3.1

Hardware requirements: NVIDIA GPU with at least 4GB memory *if you with to run Carla server*

Get and install DI-drive
===========================

First get and download the official repository with the following command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/opendilab/DI-drive.git

You can also look up tags and checkout corresponding historical version.

Install DI-drive

.. code-block:: bash

    # install for use
    # Note: use `--user` option to install the related packages in the user own directory(e.g.: ~/.local)
    pip install . --user
     
    # install for development(if you want to modify DI-drive)
    pip install -e . --user

    # install for automatically add MetaDrive simulator
    pip install '.[metadrive]' --user

DI-drive uses **DI-engine** —— distributed Reinforcement Learning system to train and evaluate RL agent.
If any questions raised when install DI-engine, please follow 
`DI-engine installation <https://opendilab.github.io/DI-engine/installation/index.html>`_ for help.
Or try to install manually via PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install di-engine --user


DI-drive supports both **Carla** and **MetaDrive**. If you want to use Carla, refer to the next section.
If you want to use MetaDrive, you can install DI-drive like above, or manually install via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install metadrive-simulator --user

.. note::

    You can configure the simulator used by DI-drive in ``core/__init__.py`` .
    Only related modules will be imported in each file. By default all simulators are used.


Additional Installation for Carla
===================================

Download and install Carla Python API
----------------------------------------

DI-drive uses Carla simulator version higher than 0.9.9. It is needed to install Carla Python API from their released pack.
If you have any problem dealing with Carla, we record some common problem you may meet in the 
`FAQ <../faq/index.html>`_ page.

-  download Carla released pack

.. code:: bash

    wget https://carla-releases.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Linux/CARLA_0.9.10.1.tar.gz
    mkdir carla_0910
    tar -xvzf CARLA_0.9.10.1.tar.gz -C carla_0910

- install Carla Python API

.. code-block:: bash

    # install compiled Carla 0910 python api, then you can import Carla in python scripts
    cd PythonAPI/carla/dist 
    easy_install --user carla-0.9.10-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg

- check import

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c 'import carla'

Then everything will be ok if no error raised.

Run Carla server
------------------------

To use Carla simulator you need to run a Carla server and use its IP host and port to connect to it.

-  run a Carla server

.. code:: bash

    cd carla_099
    # Ubuntu
    ./CarlaUE4.sh --carla-world-port=N
    # Windows
    CarlaUE4.exe --carla-world-port=N

*N* is the rpc port of Carla server, the default data port is *N + 1*. 
You will see:

.. image:: ../../figs/installation_1.png
    :alt: installation_1

You can check whether Carla server is running or not:

.. code:: bash

    lsof -i:N

If running successfully, you will see:

.. image:: ../../figs/installation_2.png
    :alt: installation_2

Now you can use DI-drive to run code under this server.
